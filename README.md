===================

Inspirational Quotes in Siri Proxy

I used the "Tell me a joke" plug-in as template and  the quotes from www.quoto.com/top-100-inspirational-quotes-of-all-time/
to create a list of 100 inspirational quotes.

To use this plug-in you just need to add the appropiate settings from the config-info.yml file into your ~/.siriproxy/config.yml file.
Then do siriproxy bundle and launch your SiriProxy with rvmsudo siriproxy server

To use just say "Inspire me" and Siri will randomly read one of the 100 inspirational quotes.
